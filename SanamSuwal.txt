Hello,
I am Sanam Suwal. Though i have not been able to attend tha last session of day 3, i was able to get required information through the videos in genese acamedy dashboard.
Besides learning git basics i had the chance to know about the hacktober fest, and MLH program. This was infact a better help of student like us to get started into learning and exploring informations of great value. Thank you milan sir of making time for session like these. 

Feedback: Everything about the session was good but as a feedback i would like the idea of puzzle game after every sessions.
